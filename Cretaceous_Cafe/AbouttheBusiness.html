                Cretaceous Cafe was to be the three-star dining restaurant for Jurassic Park.
                It was located somewhere between the Dilophosaurus and Triceratops Paddock, the restaurant's name was
                probably an allusion to these animals. Construction was said to begin in November of 1989, but never
                occurred.
